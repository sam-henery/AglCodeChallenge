# AglCodeChallenge

The solution has been engineered to filter the pet types using either command line arguments or a default pet type in the appsetting.json file.

The command line arg take precedences over the appsettings.

For the purposes of the challenge, I have configured the default in appsettings to filter for cat type, but if the reviewer wishes to test dog or fish types, then they just need to specify that type with by adding the command line arg at runtime eg "dog" or "fish" etc, or alternatively they can update the default pet type in appsettings.
